# Randomized Singular Value Paper
Repo for files and code for "On the Accuracy of Randomized Low-Rank Matrix Approximation" conference paper in the DAT390 course at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).

# Data Generation and Results
All experiments and data generation code can be found within the `notebooks/generate_results.ipynb` notebook.

The implementation of random test matrix generation can be found in `notebooks/random_test_matrix.py`, and the implementation of the randomized SVD in `notebooks/randomized_svd.py`.
