	abstract = {This paper describes a suite of algorithms for constructing low-rank approximations of an input matrix from a random linear image, or sketch, of the matrix. These methods can preserve structural properties of the input matrix, such as positive-semidefiniteness, and they can produce approximations with a user-specified rank. The algorithms are simple, accurate, numerically stable, and provably correct. Moreover, each method is accompanied by an informative error bound that allows users to select parameters a priori to achieve a given approximation quality. These claims are supported by numerical experiments with real and synthetic data.},

	abstract = {The mathematical problem of approximating one matrix by another of lower rank is closely related to the fundamental postulate of factor-theory. When formulated as a least-squares problem, the normal equations cannot be immediately written down, since the elements of the approximate matrix are not independent of one another. The solution of the problem is simplified by first expressing the matrices in a canonic form. It is found that the problem always has a solution which is usually unique. Several conclusions can be drawn from the form of this solution.},

The algorithm is straightforward to implement using standard linear algebra packages. This approach extends to the Dyson circular ensembles too. This article is based on a lecture given by the author at the summer school on Number Theory and Random Matrix Theory held at the University of Rochester in June 2006. The exposition is addressed to a general mathematical audience.},
