Our main focus is on presenting numerical experiments illustrating image restoration using various randomized singular value decomposition (RSVD) methods; theoretical error bounds, computed errors, and canonical angles analysis for these RSVD algorithms. This thesis also comes with a newly developed Matlab toolbox that contains implementations and test examples for some of the state-of-the-art randomized numerical linear algebra algorithms.},

	abstract = {In order to compute fast approximations to the singular value decompositions (SVD) of very large matrices, randomized sketching algorithms have become a leading approach. However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is that the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are from the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical worst-case error bounds, which may not account for the unique structure of a given problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads to much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these challenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that numerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. Furthermore, the method is computationally inexpensive, because it operates only on sketched objects, and hence it requires no extra passes over the full matrix being factored.},

These methods can preserve structural properties of the input matrix, such as positive-semidefiniteness, and they can produce approximations with a user-specified rank. The algorithms are simple, accurate, numerically stable, and provably correct. Moreover, each method is accompanied by an informative error bound that allows users to select parameters a priori to achieve a given approximation quality. These claims are supported by numerical experiments with real and synthetic data.},

When formulated as a least-squares problem, the normal equations cannot be immediately written down, since the elements of the approximate matrix are not independent of one another. The solution of the problem is simplified by first expressing the matrices in a canonic form. It is found that the problem always has a solution which is usually unique. Several conclusions can be drawn from the form of this solution.},
