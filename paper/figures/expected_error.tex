    \caption{The observed average rSVD approximation error and the expected upper error bound (Equation~\eqref{eq:rsvd_error}) over a range of target ranks. We see that the error bound is severely overestimating the observed error. Notice that the bound is increasing for some estimates, which is seemingly counter-intuitive.}
