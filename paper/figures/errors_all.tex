    \caption{Average errors for rSVD and best possible error achieved by the SVD over a range of rank-$k$ approximates, for different spectral decays and matrix sizes. Note that the range on the y-axis is different for each subplot. Top row: The $\ell_2$ error for both methods. Bottom row: the relative $\ell_2$ error for rSVD compared to SVD.}
